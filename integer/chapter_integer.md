integers type

These functions convert and store data to 1, 2 or 4 bytes integers.
		These data types are especially useful to store big objects such as images.


int16.md int16</a> &#8212; <span class = "refentry-description">Converts to 16-bit signed integer.
int32.md int32</a> &#8212; <span class = "refentry-description">Converts to 32-bit signed integer.
int64.md int64</a> &#8212; <span class = "refentry-description">Converts to 64-bit signed integer.
int8.md int8</a> &#8212; <span class = "refentry-description">Converts to 8-bit signed integer.
intmax.md intmax</a> &#8212; <span class = "refentry-description">Return the largest integer that can be represented in an integer type.
intmin.md intmin</a> &#8212; <span class = "refentry-description">Return the smallest integer that can be represented in an integer type.
uint16.md uint16</a> &#8212; <span class = "refentry-description">Converts to 16-bit unsigned integer.
uint32.md uint32</a> &#8212; <span class = "refentry-description">Converts to 32-bit unsigned integer.
uint64.md uint64</a> &#8212; <span class = "refentry-description">Converts to 64-bit unsigned integer.
